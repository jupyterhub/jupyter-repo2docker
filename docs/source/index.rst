repo2docker
===========

repo2docker allows you to generate Docker images from git repositories,
allowing you to construct reproducible and sharable computational
environments quickly and flexibly.

It is used heavily by the `BinderHub project
<https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. It can also be used to
effectively run a local deployment of ``BinderHub`` on your machine.

See the following pages for information about ``repo2docker`` as well
as how to create your own custom builders.
